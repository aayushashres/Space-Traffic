Space Traffic is a multiplayer game where the goal is for each "alien" to reach their home planet and collect the most coins to win. Players must avoid asteroids and fireballs and utilize spaceships in some areas to avoid falling to their death! Players have three lives each and a timer they need to race against - who will reach home first?

The game is built using Python and can be run on Processing. To run the game open the “final_project_py.pyde” file on Processing. Press the “play” button on the top left corner. More details about the game can be found on the instructions page in the game.
